# Simple quiz app

## A quiz app made with vue 3.
I made two versions which behaves differently. 
I didn't utilize any of the lifecycle hooks.

This application is created to demonstrate my fundamentals in Vue 3, JavaScript and Tailwind. 
In this application, I used vue technologies such as
- components
- props
- slots
- store (pinia)
- conditional rendering (v-if / v-show)
- event handlers
- emits
- list rendering (v-for)
- ref, reactive
- computed properties
- dynamic styling
